# exe2func
unix executable to shell function

Convert any executable to shell function
So you can get all your scripts/exe in 1 file, to copy anywhere.
Ready to be used anywhere

### Concept:
the exe file (script or binary) is compressed/base64 in the function
when calling the function decode/decomress in /tmp

Really handy when you need to manage thousands of servers
to have same env/toolbox when connecting to any of them
